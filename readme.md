#### This is a first init repo to test the functionality and ask for critics. The code is messy and ugly and needs a lot of love to hopefully look nicer later. Just don't read it! ;)

### Known bugs or TODOs:
* The history isn't implemented yet, so undo redo is meaningless.
* The transform-origin-select doesnt show the correct text on reselczing the element
* A zoom should be added
* Navigating through els is planned
* perhaps some DOM manipulation (change z-index, remove, duplicate. group-select...)
